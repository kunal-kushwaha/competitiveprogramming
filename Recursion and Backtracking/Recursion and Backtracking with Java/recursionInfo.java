	//1. Base Case - Think of the simpest possilbe input for the function.
	
	//2. Find the Relation - Think how the larger problem can be solved with the help of the solution of the smaller problem
	
	//3. Generalise - Make a generalised that solves the problem. Put this all together into a Mathematical function or a Tree
