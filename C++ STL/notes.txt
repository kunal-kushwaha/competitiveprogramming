Iterators :
An iterator is an object (like a pointer) that points to an element inside the container.
We can use iterators to move through the contents of the container.
They can be visualised as something similar to a pointer pointing to some
location and we can access content at that particular location using them.
Iterators play a critical role in connecting algorithm with containers along
with the manipulation of data stored inside the containers.
The most obvious form of iterator is a pointer.
Iterators are used :
The primary purpose of an iterator is to allow a user to process every element of a 
container while isolating the user from the internal structure of the container.
